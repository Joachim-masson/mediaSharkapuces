# mediaSharkapuces
Project from Wild Code School, which mark our very first collaboration while using gitBash and github. 
It's a web training program and it's about a website. 

## Our project
This project is called Sharkapuce because the team wanted to have a shark in the title and some another members also wanted to have carapuce (squirtle) in their group name.
So that's it: there's the name, Sharkapuce. 
We quickly decided to make a website which is about a library, about book, cd, dvd, video game... 
The project has started the 06.10.2025 and will finish for the 17.10.2025.

## Our tech used

HTML | CSS | JavaScript
